## How has the maximum temperature varied in Cairns Australia from between 1910 and 2019?

### We will answer this by: 
- Tracking the average maximum temperature each year will show a general trend of how max temperature has changed. We will look to see if there is a trend towards higher temperatures.  
- A two-sample t-tests of maximum temperature readings will be conducted for the two groups of (1910-1929) and (2000-2019). This will tell us if the difference in mean is statistically significant.

### Data

- Data set was taken from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) which is responsible for providing weather services to Australia and surrounding areas.
- The data is daily max temperature recorded from (1910-2019) at their station in Cairns Australia. This station is located at the Meteorological Office, on the western edge of Cairns Airport, on level, open ground over mowed grass.
- Due to the long running data collection.The data has been 'homogenised' which means the data has been slightly adjusted to remove artificial biases such as a weather station moving, a change in the environment (i.e. a tree grows) or a change of measurement method. This 'homogenisation' has been rigorously reviewed by experts at BOM.
